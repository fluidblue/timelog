## Installation

There are two types of installations:
The standard installation and the development installation.

If you just want to use TimeLog, the standard installation is sufficient.


### Standard installation

```
git clone https://github.com/fluidblue/timelog.git
cd timelog

npm install

npm run make
```

Finally open the compiled application, which is placed in the `out` directory.


### Development installation

```
git clone https://github.com/fluidblue/timelog.git
cd timelog

npm install

npm start
```

An electron instance will open automatically.
